## Project Structure
- `src/GameCore/` - Core interfaces and shared components
- `src/GameLauncher/` - Main application launcher
- `src/Games/Minesweeper/` - Fully implemented Minesweeper game
- `src/Games/Snake/` - Snake game placeholder
- `src/Games/Tetris/` - Tetris game placeholder

## Next Steps
1. Run the application to see the game launcher
2. Play Minesweeper to test the functionality
3. Extend Snake and Tetris games
4. Add your own games by implementing the IGame interface

## Development Tips
- The plugin architecture automatically discovers new games
- Each game should implement `IGame` interface
- Use `BaseGameStatistics` for common functionality
- Settings and statistics are automatically persisted

Enjoy building your classic games collection! ðŸŽ®
