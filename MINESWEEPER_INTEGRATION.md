# Integrating Your Existing Minesweeper

## Steps to integrate your existing Minesweeper implementation:

### 1. Copy Your Files
Copy these files from your existing Minesweeper project to:
`src/Games/Minesweeper/YourMinesweeper/`

- Cell.cs
- GameEngine.cs  
- GameSettings.cs (rename to MinesweeperSettings.cs to avoid conflicts)
- MainForm.cs (rename to MinesweeperMainForm.cs)

### 2. Update Namespaces
In each copied file, change the namespace to:
```csharp
namespace Minesweeper.YourMinesweeper
```

### 3. Update the Project File
The Minesweeper.csproj should remain as is.

### 4. Create Adapter Class
I'll create a `MinesweeperGameAdapter.cs` that:
- Implements the IGame interface
- Wraps your existing game logic
- Handles the integration with our launcher

### 5. Update Game Registration
Update the GameDiscoveryService to use your implementation.

Would you like me to create the adapter structure so you can easily drop in your existing files?
